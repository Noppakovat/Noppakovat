- 🌼 Hi, I’m Narinee (@Noppakovat), but I prefer to go by Rita
- 💐 I’m looking to collaborate on whatever is thrown at me that I can somewhat navigate with or without help
- 🌻 I’m interested in:
  - Understanding how & why things operate
  - Working in groups
  - Obsessing over code that doesn't work as intended
  - Fixing aforementioned code, so that it does work as intended
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - About the limitations I have with certain languages
    - Typically speaking, my issues are with terminology
  - How to improve personally & in group settings
